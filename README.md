## Calendar add-ons
### Availability Exporter
Automatically exports ranges of ***free*** time you have, either as a simple textual list, table format, or .ics calendar file. This was mainly made for whenever a recruiter asks for your availability in day-times format, sometimes in a table, but this could be useful for sharing your availability in general.

Options:
- Specify start and end dates (inclusive)
- Specify calendars whose scheduled events will be considered as ***busy*** time
- Specify padding before/after scheduled events
- Specify min/max time of the day (you wouldn't want to tell a recruiter you're free at 3am for an interview)
- Specify minimum time slot size (doesn't make sense to share a 15 minute availability if you're trying to schedule a 1-hr meeting)
- Specify time zone to export as
- Specify start/end boundaries -- 15, 30, or 1 hour boundaries (in case you want to avoid telling someone you're available at weird start/end times, like 1:03pm - 3:47pm)
